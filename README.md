Bannerstalker
=============

This is the old version of Bannerstalker, written in Haskell using the Yesod framework.
This ran for Spring and Summer 2013, until it was replaced by a Python/Django rewrite in the Fall.
It's now open source, so if anyone wants to try to learn something from my terrible Haskell code,
they may help themselves.
